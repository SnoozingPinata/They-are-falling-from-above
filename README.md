# They-are-falling-from-above


Forked from: https://github.com/ivan-resetnikov-a/They-are-falling-from-above

Just wanted to add a couple of features that looked fun (randomly generated levels and blocks that disappear), but saw some code issues. 
Planning on fixing some things up, adding the features, and then handing this back to the author if they want it. 

TODO:
  * Change how sound works
  * Add randomly generated levels
  * Add different types of tiles that disappear.
  * Clean up Main
  * make code more pythonic and easier to read
  * "enemy" class shouldn't be changing player, camera, or anything else
  * fix "enemy" uses function from "player" class
  * make game over work gracefully
  * start game menu
  * game over menu
